Git it's a powerfull tool to version manager control. But, his have many details. Recently, i've problems with git clone:

#####Git fatal: protocol 'https' is not supported

To resolve this, just:

```sh
git clone "https://myRepo/a.git"
```

Yes, only between quotation marks.


and that's all folks!

To any doubt, problem or suggestion, just say.
