Certainly, you used while and else. But, Python have one structure called while/else. For example

```python
while condition:
    doStuff()
else:
    doAnotherStuff()
```

It's seem strange, but this make sense. The condition in while will be evaluate, if true, while will be executed, if false, the inner while will not executed.
But, if, while never execute, the condition else, will be executed. Only this situation.

and that's all folks!

To any doubt, problem or suggestion, just say.
