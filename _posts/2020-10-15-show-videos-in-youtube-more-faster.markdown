I use Youtube to watch many video. But, most of videos i like watch faster.
By default, Youtube provides 2x speed, but to go faster, just:

```
    document.getElementsByTagName("video")[0].playbackRate = 3
```

Now, you can watch videos faster.

and that's all folks!

If you have any doubts, problems or suggestions, just leave a message.
